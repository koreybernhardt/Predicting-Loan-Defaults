# Predicting Loan Defaults - MSDS Curriculum Project
This project was completed as part of a graduate degree program and highlights various aspects of data analysis and modeling as well as R code proficiency. The premise is one that is common in risk management, using historical data to identify factors that contribute to a lower risk profile, and developing a model that effectively identifies boundaries for risk acceptance.
